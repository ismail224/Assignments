The adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>
